Once your Raspberry Pi is ready,

1. update and upgrade
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

2. Pre-steps on Raspberry Pi
Copy wifi setting file
Create ssh file 
SPI enabled
expand file system

3. Install TTN- Packet forwarder
$ git clone -b spi https://github.com/ttn-zh/ic880a-gateway.git ~/temp
$ cd ~/temp
$ sudo ./install.sh spi

======================================================================
    Keep note of gateway EUI.
    Disable TTN Packet forwarder.
    sudo systemctl disable ttn-gateway.service
    Edit global_conf.json in Basic Packet forwarder.
    cd /opt/ttn-gateway/packet_forwarder/basic_pkt_fwd/
    Refer here 62 for global_config.json for different channel plans.
    Don’t copy and paste the file as it is. Change the SX1301 part only and edit gateway EUI
    Change Server address to point at your Gateway Bridge. If Gateway bridge is running on your gateway change as follows.
    "server_address": "127.0.0.1",
    Reset the gateway. Try the following script from Naresh 37
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "17" > /sys/class/gpio/export
    echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/direction
    echo "1" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/value
    sleep 5
    echo "0" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/value
    sleep 1
    echo "0" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/value
    Run the script as root It’s a sysfs implementation hence SU privileges.
    Start the packet forwarder.
    sudo ./basic_pkt_fwd
    You should see packets being forwarded.
    Try sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog to check for errors, if any.
